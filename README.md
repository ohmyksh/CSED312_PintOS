This project was completed as part of the **Operating Systems** course at POSTECH in Fall 2023. We implemented PintOS, a teaching operating system designed by Stanford University, following their official documentation.

This branch contains the latest version of the code, completed up to Project 3.

We successfully passed Projects 1, 2, and 3. Notably, Projects 2 and 3 were tested extensively by running them 100 times using a shell script, and they passed every time.
